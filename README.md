# random-password-generator 

## quick presentation : 

this Python script generates a strong, random password based on user preferences!
you can choose the length of the password and include different types of characters such as lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.

```python
def generate_password(length: int = 12): #length (here of 12 digits)
alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation  #types of characters
```
this script could ensure your password is secure and meets typical security requirements by coding it by your own ;)

## inspiration :

- book = Python pour les Nuls, 3e Ã©dition 

### of course you are absolutely free to re-use it and re-style it as you need and wish :)

a pleasure!
